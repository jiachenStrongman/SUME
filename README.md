# SUME

Hello

Thanks for stopping by the SUME repository here.

I am trying to make sume a service for those who just don't know what to spend their money on.

I mean that in two ways. Before I begin, I just want to say, it's really hard to make money in this world. We grind and grind, learn new skills and aquire new credientials, just to make money.
So then, don't you absolutly hate it when you waste your time/money online shopping and getting something you didn't want in the first place. 

I love online shoping. I love finding out about products I didn't know exsisted. I just want to make sure that everyone gets to know what is worth buying and what isn't. 
Amazon is full of fake reviews made by bots or people that were paid off and we (the consumer) end up suffering the consequences of this misinformation.

Even if this has never happened to you, don't you ever shop online and wonder if say, a soundbar for your home theatre setup sounds any good. Or say you've been an iPhone user for the longest time and you want to switch to andriod. How do you know which one to get without digging through YouTube to find a reviewer that wasn't paid to make a video. 

Online shopping is so young, and it's time for it to mature. SUME is going to be whatever you (the user) make it to be. But to start, I'm making it just a 3, tabbed site. Lets see where we head from there.
