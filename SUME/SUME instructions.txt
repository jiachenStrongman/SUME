Hello

thanks for reading this

I am making SUME because we are overwhelmed by too much stuff to buy online.
You can buy EVERYTHING online and have it show up at your doorstep.
Except Ikea merchandise.
But, the issue is, most of what we can buy is crap. 
"influencers" are just online sales people and the 5 star rating system is just not reliable. 
SUME makes things real again. 
The only reason people still go to stores is to be able to hold and experience what they want to spend their hard earned money on.
I don't know how good a pair of headphones sound through the web.
I don't know if this stylish backpack will hold my 4 textbooks.
The online marketplace is still immature. 
You wouldn't walk into someones garage and buy clothes but you would if they had a flashy website.
You only paid $50 more because this "reputable brand" is bought by everyone else. 
I want to verify shopping, give small businesses credit they deserve and take away big businesses' false advertising. 
I will make what you see on your screen even more real. 
The try before you buy.
No more printing out return labels.
No more buyers remorse.
Stop being a wasteful shopper. 

Welcome to SUME.
